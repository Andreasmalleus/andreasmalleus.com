Go-rest-api was made because I wanted to learn a bit about Go. What better way to learn, than to create a project with the said language and so I decided to create a REST API with the Gin framework. 

Features

CRUD operations for user  
CRUD operations for post  
Everything is stored in PostgreSQL database  

Built with

[Go](https://go.dev)  
[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
